sX Makers Ruby Tutorial no 3
============================

My notes from 10/19/13 are in rubytalknotes.rb

We covered loops (while/until, for, and the more
common iterator) and hashes. We didn't quite get
to scraping using hashes, but I included some example
code (wrek.rb) anyway. If you have any questions,
please reach out to me or to Brendan. Happy Rubying!!


cheers,

Julian
